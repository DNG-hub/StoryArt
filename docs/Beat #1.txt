The Mobile Medical Base hummed with the low thrum of filtered air and the occasional beep of dormant diagnostic equipment. Sunlight streamed through the reinforced windshield, casting sharp rectangles across the cluttered workbench where Cat Mitchell sat hunched over her terminal. The sterile scent of antiseptic lingered beneath the faint metallic tang of old wiring—life preserved in a rolling tomb. She scrolled through fragmented logs pulled from the NHIA cartridge—the same warped data drive they'd pried from Facility 7's ruins, lines of corrupted code blurring into static. Her fingers moved with practiced precision, but tension coiled in her shoulders. Beside her, Daniel O'Brien stood sentinel by the rear door, his back straight, eyes scanning the quiet perimeter beyond the tinted windows. He hadn't moved in ten minutes. Not even to adjust the rifle slung across his chest.
