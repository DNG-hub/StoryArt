# Beat Generation System Evolution - Change Documentation

## Overview
This document details the evolution of the StoryArt beat generation system from its original 4-6 beats per scene limitation to the current 91 NEW_IMAGE beats system. It serves as a reference for future refinement and optimization.

## Original System (Baseline)
- **Beat Count**: 4-6 beats per scene
- **Image Decision**: Conservative approach favoring REUSE_IMAGE
- **Narrative Detail**: Basic summaries
- **Target**: General visual storytelling

## Problem Statement
The user needed **11+ images per scene** for 8-minute YouTube content, but the system was only generating 3-4 beats per scene, resulting in insufficient visual variety for engaging content.

## Evolution Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Schema Changes
**Files Modified**: `services/geminiService.ts`, `services/enhancedAnalysisService.ts`, `services/qwenService.ts`

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// BEFORE
description: "A list of 4-6 distinct narrative macro-beats"

// AFTER  
description: "A list of distinct narrative beats... up to a maximum of 50 beats per scene."
```

**Why**: Removed the hard-coded 4-6 beat limitation to allow more granular segmentation.

**Result**: Still only generated 7-10 beats per scene - insufficient improvement.

### Phase 2: Aggressive System Instructions
**Files Modified**: Same as Phase 1

**Changes Made**:
- Added explicit minimum requirements (25+ beats per scene)
- Detailed beat segmentation examples
- Ultra-granular segmentation rules
- Enhanced validation checks

**Key System Instruction Addition**:
```
**CRITICAL IMAGE GENERATION REQUIREMENT: Each scene is 8 minutes long and requires 11+ NEW_IMAGE beats. You MUST generate enough beats to create 11+ NEW_IMAGE decisions per scene. Target 15-20 NEW_IMAGE beats per scene with additional REUSE_IMAGE beats. This means you need 30-40 total beats per scene to achieve proper image distribution.**

**BEAT SEGMENTATION EXAMPLES:**
- If a character says "Hello" - that's Beat 1
- If they pause and look around - that's Beat 2  
- If they say "What's that?" - that's Beat 3
- If they walk toward something - that's Beat 4
- If they stop and examine it - that's Beat 5
- If they say "Interesting..." - that's Beat 6
- If they reach out to touch it - that's Beat 7
- If they pull back quickly - that's Beat 8
- If they say "It's hot!" - that's Beat 9
- If they look at their companion - that's Beat 10
- And so on... EVERY single action, word, pause, and moment gets its own beat.
```

**Why**: The AI model needed explicit examples and rules to understand the required granularity level.

**Result**: Beat count increased to 25-40 per scene, but still insufficient NEW_IMAGE beats.

### Phase 3: Image Decision Logic Overhaul
**Files Modified**: Same as Phase 1

**Changes Made**:
- Modified image decision rules to heavily favor NEW_IMAGE
- Updated pacing rules for 8-minute scenes
- Enhanced validation to require 11+ NEW_IMAGE beats per scene

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// BEFORE: Conservative image reuse
- **'NEW_IMAGE':** For significant visual changes
- **'REUSE_IMAGE':** When characters are in similar positions

// AFTER: Aggressive new image generation
- **'NEW_IMAGE':** For ANY distinct visual moment in an 8-minute scene. Valid reasons: character appearance, location change, camera angle change, character movement, action sequence, emotional shift, dialogue exchange, discovery, reaction, or any significant moment. Target 15-20 NEW_IMAGE beats per scene for 8-minute content.
- **'REUSE_IMAGE':** ONLY when characters are in the EXACT same position, pose, and context for multiple consecutive beats. Use sparingly - only 5-10 REUSE_IMAGE beats per scene maximum.
```

**Why**: The original system was too conservative with image reuse, not generating enough visual variety for 8-minute content.

**Result**: Achieved 11+ NEW_IMAGE beats per scene, but created new problems.

### Phase 4: Prompt Generation Failure
**Problem**: With 91 NEW_IMAGE beats, the prompt generation step was timing out and failing.

**Root Cause**: The AI model was overwhelmed by the large number of beats being processed in a single request.

**Solution**: Implemented batch processing in `services/promptGenerationService.ts`

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// BEFORE: Single request for all beats
const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    contents: `Generate SwarmUI prompts for ${allBeats.length} beats...`
});

// AFTER: Batch processing
const BATCH_SIZE = 20; // Process 20 beats at a time
const batches = [];
for (let i = 0; i < beatsForPrompting.length; i += BATCH_SIZE) {
    batches.push(beatsForPrompting.slice(i, i + BATCH_SIZE));
}

// Process each batch separately
for (let batchIndex = 0; batchIndex < batches.length; batchIndex++) {
    const batch = batches[batchIndex];
    const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
        contents: `Generate SwarmUI prompts for batch ${batchIndex + 1}...`
    });
    // Process batch results...
}
```

**Why**: Large token counts were causing timeouts and failures. Batch processing allows the AI to handle manageable chunks.

**Result**: Prompt generation now completes successfully with 91 beats.

### Phase 6: YOLO Segmentation Parameter Fix
**Problem**: YOLO segmentation tags using outdated parameters causing SwarmUI warnings and suboptimal face detection.

**Root Cause**: SwarmUI now properly enforces YOLO thresholds, making our old parameters problematic:
- `IoU=1` meant "require 100% confidence" - SwarmUI resets to 0.25 and warns
- `Confidence=0.7` was too high for many face detections
- `yolov9c.pt` model was outdated

**Solution**: Updated YOLO segmentation parameters in prompt generation services.

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// BEFORE: Problematic parameters
<segment:yolo-face_yolov9c.pt-INDEX,0.7,1>
<segment:yolo-face_yolov9c.pt,0.7,0.5>

// AFTER: Optimized parameters  
<segment:yolo-face_yolo11m-seg.pt-INDEX,0.35,0.5>
<segment:yolo-face_yolo11m-seg.pt,0.35,0.5>
```

**Key Improvements**:
- **Model**: `yolov9c.pt` → `yolo11m-seg.pt` (latest YOLO11 medium segmentation)
- **Confidence**: `0.7` → `0.35` (more balanced detection)
- **IoU**: `1` → `0.5` (prevents SwarmUI warnings and resets)

**Files Modified**:
- `services/promptGenerationService.ts` - Updated system instructions
- `services/qwenPromptService.ts` - Updated YOLO tag format
- `docs/YOLO_SEGMENTATION_TUNING.md` - Comprehensive tuning guide

**Why**: SwarmUI's new YOLO threshold enforcement made our old parameters cause warnings and poor face detection. The new parameters provide better balance between accuracy and performance.

**Result**: Improved face detection accuracy and eliminated SwarmUI warnings.

- **91 NEW_IMAGE beats** generated (exceeds 11+ requirement)
- **Batch processing** prevents timeouts
- **Database context integration** working
- **LORA trigger substitution** implemented
- **Detailed narrative content** for each beat

### Current Metrics
- **Total Beats**: ~91 per episode

- **REUSE_IMAGE Beats**: ~0 (very low reuse rate)
- **Processing Time**: ~2-3 minutes for full episode
- **Batch Count**: 5 batches of 20 beats each

### Known Issues & Areas for Refinement

#### 1. **Over-Generation Problem**
- **Issue**: Generating 91 beats when only 11+ are needed
- **Impact**: Unnecessary processing time and API costs
- **Root Cause**: System instructions are too aggressive
- **Refinement Needed**: Balance between sufficient beats and efficiency

#### 2. **Image Reuse Logic Too Conservative**
- **Issue**: Almost no image reuse (0 REUSE_IMAGE beats)
- **Impact**: Missing optimization opportunities
- **Root Cause**: Rules favor NEW_IMAGE too heavily
- **Refinement Needed**: Smarter reuse detection for similar visual moments

#### 3. **Beat Granularity Inconsistency**
- **Issue**: Some beats are too granular (single word), others too broad
- **Impact**: Inconsistent pacing and visual flow
- **Root Cause**: AI interpretation varies despite examples
- **Refinement Needed**: More precise granularity guidelines

#### 4. **Processing Efficiency**
- **Issue**: 5 batches × 20 beats = 5 API calls for prompt generation
- **Impact**: Higher costs and longer processing time
- **Root Cause**: Conservative batch size
- **Refinement Needed**: Optimize batch size and reduce API calls

#### 5. **Narrative Content Quality**
- **Issue**: Some beats have minimal narrative content
- **Impact**: Poor correlation between script and generated images
- **Root Cause**: AI focuses on quantity over quality
- **Refinement Needed**: Quality validation and content requirements

## Recommended Refinement Strategy

### Phase 1: Optimization (Immediate)
1. **Reduce Beat Count**: Target 15-20 beats per scene (60-80 total) instead of 91
2. **Improve Reuse Logic**: Implement smarter image reuse detection
