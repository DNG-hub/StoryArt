# StoryTeller AI - Implementation Plan for Content Expansion & Automation

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for expanding the application's capabilities to include new content types (vertical shorts prompts, hook narratives) and direct SwarmUI API integration for a fully automated script-to-image pipeline.

## üéØ **Critical Database Integration Discovery**

**‚úÖ MAJOR PROGRESS UPDATE:** Several critical Phase 2 components have been completed, including database schema enhancement, character appearance system, location override mapping, and NHIA Facility 7 hierarchical analysis.

**Phase 2 has been significantly enhanced** based on database analysis revealing:

### **üìä Rich Database Context Available:**
- **12 detailed locations** with visual descriptions and atmospheric context
- **37 artifacts** with ready-to-use SwarmUI prompt fragments  
- **26 character-location contexts** with detailed appearance data
- **6 complete SwarmUI prompt overrides** ready for immediate use

### **üîó Location Override Mapping System:**
**Key Discovery:** Roadmap data drives location selection, but tactical locations should use Atlanta Emergency Zone SwarmUI overrides for character appearance.

**Mapping Rules:**
- `roadmap_scenes.location_name = "NHIA Facility 7"` ‚Üí Use Atlanta Emergency Zone character overrides
- **Reason:** NHIA Facility 7 is bombed/tactical environment requiring protective gear
- **Result:** Consistent tactical character appearance across similar environments

### **üí° Implementation Priority:**
**Phase 2.0 (Database Context Integration) must be implemented FIRST** before SwarmUI automation, as it provides 10x more visual detail than current constants-based approach.

### **üè¢ NHIA Facility 7 - Multi-Floor Building Analysis**

**Current Issue:** NHIA Facility 7 is described as a single location, but the narrative reveals it's a multi-floor CDC archive and data center with distinct areas that need separate treatment.

**Narrative Analysis from Constants:**
- **Main Building:** CDC archive and data center (post-downfall destruction)
- **Specific Areas Identified:**
  - **Ground Level:** Reception area, corridors with shattered containment pods and lab equipment
  - **Lower Level:** Data vault accessed through reinforced door (primary target)
  - **Server Room:** Revealed within the vault when opened, contains server racks
  - **Movement Sequence:** Cat moves "deeper" through facility ‚Üí finds reinforced vault door ‚Üí opens vault ‚Üí discovers server room inside

**Database Structure Analysis:**
- **Current Limitation:** No parent/child location hierarchy in `location_arcs` table
- **Available Fields:** `location_type` (SPECIFIC/GENERAL), `significance_level`, `atmosphere_category`
- **Artifact Association:** 8 artifacts currently associated with main NHIA Facility 7

**Required Implementation:**

#### **2.0.4. Hierarchical Location System:**
```sql
-- Proposed database enhancement (requires schema modification)
ALTER TABLE location_arcs ADD COLUMN parent_location_id UUID REFERENCES location_arcs(id);
ALTER TABLE location_arcs ADD COLUMN floor_level INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE location_arcs ADD COLUMN area_type VARCHAR(50); -- 'reception', 'server_room', 'vault', 'corridor', etc.
```

#### **2.0.5. NHIA Facility 7 Child Locations:**
```typescript
const nhiaFacility7ChildLocations = {
  "NHIA Facility 7 - Reception Area": {
    location_type: "SPECIFIC",
    area_type: "reception", 
    floor_level: 1,
    visual_description: "Destroyed reception area with scattered debris, broken security checkpoint, emergency lighting casting shadows across abandoned visitor logs and shattered glass partitions.",
    artifacts: ["concrete_rubble", "shattered_windows", "emergency_lighting"]
  },
  
  "NHIA Facility 7 - Data Vault": {
    location_type: "SPECIFIC", 
    area_type: "vault",
    floor_level: -1, // Lower level - accessed by going deeper into facility
    visual_description: "Underground data vault accessed through reinforced door, containing rows of shattered containment pods, abandoned lab equipment, reinforced concrete walls, emergency lighting creating long shadows.",
    artifacts: ["Shattered Containment Pods", "medical_equipment", "The Original SledBed"]
  },
  
  "NHIA Facility 7 - Server Room": {
    location_type: "SPECIFIC",
    area_type: "server_room", 
    floor_level: -1, // Same level as vault - servers revealed when vault is opened
    visual_description: "Hardened server room revealed within the vault, rows of server racks with blinking status lights, emergency backup systems, clinical white walls with biohazard warnings.",
    artifacts: ["server_racks", "Emergency Biohazard Warnings", "emergency_lighting"]
  },
  
  "NHIA Facility 7 - Corridors": {
    location_type: "GENERAL",
    area_type: "corridor", 
    floor_level: 0, // Ground level
    visual_description: "Long sterile corridors with emergency lights casting dancing shadows, abandoned computer terminals, scattered debris from the explosion.",
    artifacts: ["concrete_rubble", "emergency_lighting", "shattered_windows"]
  }
};
```

#### **2.0.6. Artifact Redistribution Strategy:**
- **Reception Area:** Structural damage artifacts (concrete_rubble, shattered_windows)
- **Server Room:** Technical artifacts (server_racks, biohazard warnings)  
- **Data Vault:** Medical/research artifacts (containment pods, SledBed, medical equipment)
- **Corridors:** General atmospheric artifacts (emergency lighting, general debris)

**Implementation Priority:** This hierarchical system must be implemented before SwarmUI automation to ensure consistent visual storytelling across different areas of the same building.

### **üèóÔ∏è Hierarchical Location System - Complete Analysis**

#### **2.0.7. Database Schema Enhancement Required:**
```sql
-- Required schema modifications for parent/child location support
ALTER TABLE location_arcs ADD COLUMN parent_location_id UUID REFERENCES location_arcs(id);
ALTER TABLE location_arcs ADD COLUMN floor_level INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE location_arcs ADD COLUMN area_type VARCHAR(50); -- 'reception', 'server_room', 'vault', 'corridor', 'office', 'lab', etc.
ALTER TABLE location_arcs ADD COLUMN access_method VARCHAR(100); -- 'stairs', 'elevator', 'door', 'corridor', etc.
```

#### **2.0.8. NHIA Facility 7 - ‚úÖ COMPLETED Layout:**
**Narrative Sequence:** Ground Level ‚Üí Move Deeper ‚Üí Reinforced Vault Door ‚Üí Open Vault ‚Üí Server Room Inside
**‚úÖ Status:** Complete hierarchical layout documented and implemented in database schema

```typescript
const nhiaFacility7Hierarchy = {
  "NHIA Facility 7": {
    parent_location_id: null, // Root location
    floor_level: 0,
    area_type: "building",
    visual_description: "CDC archive and data center, post-downfall destruction"
  },
  
  "NHIA Facility 7 - Reception Area": {
    parent_location_id: "NHIA Facility 7",
    floor_level: 0,
    area_type: "reception",
    access_method: "main entrance",
    visual_description: "Destroyed reception area with scattered debris, broken security checkpoint"
  },
  
  "NHIA Facility 7 - Corridors": {
    parent_location_id: "NHIA Facility 7", 
    floor_level: 0,
    area_type: "corridor",
    access_method: "from reception",
    visual_description: "Long sterile corridors with emergency lighting, abandoned terminals"
  },
  
  "NHIA Facility 7 - Data Vault": {
    parent_location_id: "NHIA Facility 7",
    floor_level: -1,
    area_type: "vault", 
    access_method: "reinforced door (go deeper)",
    visual_description: "Underground vault accessed through reinforced door, containing containment pods and lab equipment"
  },
  
  "NHIA Facility 7 - Server Room": {
    parent_location_id: "NHIA Facility 7 - Data Vault",
    floor_level: -1,
    area_type: "server_room",
    access_method: "inside vault",
    visual_description: "Server room revealed within vault, rows of server racks with biohazard warnings"
  }
};
```

#### **2.0.9. Other Locations Requiring Sub-Area Analysis:**

**Investigation Required for Additional Multi-Area Locations:**

1. **Dr. Chen's Enhancement Facility:**
   - Likely contains: Labs, offices, patient rooms, surgical suites
   - **Investigation Needed:** What specific areas are mentioned in narrative?

2. **Underground Facility Alpha:**
   - Likely contains: Multiple levels, command centers, storage areas
   - **Investigation Needed:** What sub-areas are referenced?

3. **Mobile Medical Base:**
   - Likely contains: Examination area, computer station, storage
   - **Investigation Needed:** Specific compartments mentioned?

4. **Daniel's Safehouse:**
   - Likely contains: Living area, tactical room, storage
   - **Investigation Needed:** What rooms/areas are described?

5. **Ghost's Digital Lair:**
   - Likely contains: Server areas, interface zones, control rooms
   - **Investigation Needed:** What digital spaces exist?

#### **2.0.10. Implementation Strategy:**

**Phase 2.0.1: Database Schema Enhancement**
- Add parent/child relationship fields to `location_arcs`
- Create migration scripts for existing data
- Update foreign key constraints

**Phase 2.0.2: Location Hierarchy Analysis**
- Review all narrative sources for sub-location references
- Document explicit vs. implied sub-areas for each major location
- Create hierarchical mapping for each multi-area location

**Phase 2.0.3: Artifact Redistribution**
- Move artifacts from parent locations to appropriate child locations
- Ensure visual consistency within each sub-area
- Maintain artifact relationships across hierarchy levels

**Phase 2.0.4: SwarmUI Integration**
- Update prompt generation to use child location context
- Apply character appearance rules to specific sub-areas
- Ensure consistent visual storytelling across location hierarchy

**Critical Note:** This hierarchical system is essential for accurate visual storytelling, as treating complex facilities as single locations leads to inconsistent and inadequate scene descriptions.

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Detail Deficiencies - Critical Analysis**

**Status:** üîç **ANALYZED** - Several tasks lack sufficient implementation details for successful execution.

#### **Critical Deficiencies Requiring Immediate Attention:**

**1. Database Schema Enhancement (2.0.7) - ‚úÖ COMPLETED**
- **Constraint:** Cannot modify primary StoryTeller database structure
- **Solution:** ‚úÖ Created separate `storyart_location_hierarchy` table for hierarchical data
- **Completed Details:**
  - ‚úÖ Migration script created (`docs/database_schema_enhancement.sql`)
  - ‚úÖ Data synchronization strategy with existing `location_arcs` implemented
  - ‚úÖ Rollback procedures created (`docs/rollback_script.sql`)
  - ‚úÖ Testing strategy documented (`docs/testing_strategy.md`)
  - ‚úÖ NHIA Facility 7 hierarchy initialized with child locations

**2. Database Context Service Implementation (2.0.1) - CRITICAL**
- **Missing Details:**
  - Connection pool management for PostgreSQL
  - Error handling when database unavailable
  - Caching strategy for frequently accessed data
  - Query optimization for performance
  - TypeScript interfaces for new data structures

**3. Location Hierarchy Analysis (2.0.2) - HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Missing Details:**
  - Narrative source identification methodology
  - Step-by-step analysis process for sub-area identification
  - Data extraction process from narrative sources

**4. Artifact Redistribution (2.0.3) - HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Missing Details:**
  - Migration script for moving artifacts to child locations
  - Validation logic for correct artifact distribution
  - Conflict resolution when artifacts belong to multiple sub-areas
  - Data integrity maintenance during redistribution

#### **Medium Priority Items Requiring Discussion:**

**5. SwarmUI Integration (2.0.4) - REQUIRES DISCUSSION**
- **Constraint:** Must maintain current prompt generation process
- **Constraint:** Dashboard output must remain unchanged for human-in-the-loop
- **Constraint:** Intersects with Phase 3 requirements
- **Status:** Discussion deferred until other issues implemented

**6. Enhanced Prompt Generation (2.0.3) - REQUIRES DISCUSSION**
- **Current Assessment:** Manual switch process may be sufficient
- **Status:** Discussion deferred until other issues implemented

**7. Roadmap-Driven Location Resolution (2.0.4) - REQUIRES DISCUSSION**
- **Rationale Unclear:** Need to understand business justification
- **Status:** Discussion deferred until other issues implemented

#### **Low Priority Items:**

**8. Phase 3 Interactive Prompt Refinement - DEFERRED**
- **Status:** Keep low priority, implement Phase 2 first
- **Rationale:** Phase 2 provides foundation for Phase 3 enhancements

#### **Implementation Strategy:**

**Phase 2.0.1: Address Critical Deficiencies**
- Create detailed implementation plans for items 1-4
- Develop migration strategies that don't impact StoryTeller
- Design error handling and rollback procedures

**Phase 2.0.2: Deferred Discussion Items**
- Address items 5-7 after critical deficiencies resolved
- Use implementation experience to inform discussions
- Ensure solutions align with StoryTeller constraints

**Phase 2.0.3: Phase 3 Preparation**
- Complete Phase 2 implementation before Phase 3
- Use Phase 2 learnings to enhance Phase 3 planning

### **üîÑ Frontend Default Configuration - Database Mode**

#### **2.0.11. Default Database Mode Implementation:**

**Configuration Changes Made:**
```typescript
// App_updated.tsx - Default to database mode
const [retrievalMode, setRetrievalMode] = useState<RetrievalMode>('database');

// Use environment variable for story ID with fallback
const [storyUuid, setStoryUuid] = useState<string>(
  import.meta.env.VITE_CAT_DANIEL_STORY_ID || '59f64b1e-726a-439d-a6bc-0dfefcababdb'
);
```

**Automatic Context Loading:**
- **On Startup:** Application defaults to database mode
- **Auto-Load:** Episode context automatically fetched from database on app load
- **Environment Integration:** Uses `VITE_CAT_DANIEL_STORY_ID` from `.env` file
- **Fallback:** Hardcoded story ID if environment variable not available

**User Experience:**
- **No Manual Switch Required:** Database mode is active by default
- **Immediate Data:** Episode context loads automatically into textarea
- **Development Ready:** Uses development story ID from environment
- **Production Ready:** Can be changed to production story ID when needed

**Implementation Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- Database mode is now the default
- Story ID uses environment variable `VITE_CAT_DANIEL_STORY_ID`
- Context automatically loads on startup
- Manual mode still available as fallback option

### **üë§ Character Appearance System - ‚úÖ COMPLETED:**
**Complete character appearance specifications have been documented and implemented** for consistent visual storytelling across all locations:

- **Cat Mitchell:** Tactical bun (field) ‚Üí Ponytail (office) ‚Üí Hair down (safehouse)
- **Daniel O'Brien:** Full tactical gear (field) ‚Üí Camo pants/shirt (office) ‚Üí Jeans/t-shirt (safehouse)  
- **Dr. Chen:** Professional medical/research attire (all locations)
- **Col. Webb:** Battle dress (field) ‚Üí Uniform with jacket (office)
- **Preacher:** Priest-like frock (all locations)

**‚úÖ Implementation Status:** Character appearance system fully documented in PLAN.md with detailed SwarmUI override specifications for all location types (Field, Office, Safehouse, Special).

**This system ensures visual consistency and character-appropriate styling across all story locations.**

## Phase 1: Content Generation & UI Expansion

**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
**Goal:** Enhance the AI's content generation abilities and update the user interface to display all new assets clearly. This phase focuses on getting the core content right before automating its use.

-   [x] **1.1. Dual Prompt Generation:** Modified `promptGenerationService` to produce two distinct prompts (Cinematic 16:9 and Vertical 9:16) for each `NEW_IMAGE` beat.
-   [x] **1.2. Episode Style Configuration:** Added a collapsible "Episode Style Configuration" section in the `InputPanel` to allow users to define consistent stylistic parameters for an entire episode.
-   [x] **1.3. UI Overhaul for New Content:** Redesigned the `OutputPanel` with a tabbed interface within each `BeatAnalysisCard` to cleanly display the dual prompts.
-   [ ] **1.4. Hook Narrative Generation (Future Step):**
    -   Create a new AI-powered service to generate short, engaging narrative hooks for each key beat.
    -   Add a new section to the `BeatAnalysisCard` to display this narrative.

---

## Phase 2: Database Integration & SwarmUI Automation

**Status:** üìã **PLANNED**
**Goal:** Integrate rich database context with SwarmUI automation, enabling data-driven prompt generation and one-click image creation.

### **2.0. Database Context Integration (NEW - CRITICAL)**

-   [ ] **2.0.1. Database Context Service:**
    -   Implement `services/databaseContextService.ts` to fetch location, character, and artifact data
    -   Query `location_arcs`, `location_artifacts`, and `character_location_contexts` tables

        - **SAFEHOUSE LOCATIONS** (Casual): Use relaxed, sexy casual style
        - **SPECIAL LOCATIONS** (Ghost's Lair): Use unique styling
    -   **Character Appearance Rules:**
        ```typescript
        const locationOverrideMapping = {
          // FIELD LOCATIONS - Tactical gear, tactical bun
          "Atlanta Emergency Zone": "Atlanta Emergency Zone",           // Direct match
          "NHIA Facility 7": "Atlanta Emergency Zone",                  // Tactical override
          "Underground Facility Alpha": "Atlanta Emergency Zone",       // Tactical override
          "Military Black Site": "Atlanta Emergency Zone",              // Tactical override
          "Derelict Warehouse": "Atlanta Emergency Zone",               // Tactical override
          "General Location - Dangerous Terrain": "Atlanta Emergency Zone", // Tactical override
          "General Location - Urban Ruins": "Atlanta Emergency Zone",   // Tactical override
          "General Location - Decommissioned Outpost": "Atlanta Emergency Zone", // Tactical override
          
          // OFFICE LOCATIONS - Business casual futuristic
          "OmniGen HQ": "Office Professional",                          // Corporate headquarters
          "Dr. Chen's Enhancement Facility": "Office Professional",     // Corporate lab
          "Archives Level 4": "Office Professional",                   // Corporate archive
          "Medical Lab": "Office Professional",                        // Corporate medical
          "Radiology Wing": "Office Professional",                     // Corporate medical
          "Mobile Medical Base": "Office Professional",                // Corporate mobile
          
          // SAFEHOUSE LOCATIONS - Casual, sexy, relaxed
          "Dan's Safehouse": "Safehouse Casual",                       // Direct match
          "Rumored Safe Haven": "Safehouse Casual",                    // Safe haven
          
          // SPECIAL LOCATIONS - Unique styling
          "Ghost's Digital Lair": "Ghost Digital"                      // Digital/tech environment
        };
        ```
    -   **Character Appearance Specifications:**
        - **Cat - Field Locations:** Tactical bun, tactical field gear, tactical vest, combat boots
        - **Cat - Office Locations:** Ponytail, business casual futuristic (cyberpunk style)
        - **Cat - Safehouse:** Hair down and loose, jeans and t-shirt, loose/open clothing (simple but super sexy)
        - **Daniel - Field Locations:** Full tactical gear, plate carrier, weapons systems
        - **Daniel - Office Locations:** Camo pants and camo t-shirt
        - **Daniel - Safehouse:** Jeans and t-shirt, relaxed tactical wear
        - **Dr. Chen - All Locations:** Professional medical/research attire, clinical appearance, corporate authority
        - **Col. Webb - Field Locations:** Battle dress uniform, military tactical gear
        - **Col. Webb - Office Locations:** Military uniform with jacket, formal military appearance
        - **Preacher - All Locations:** Priest-like frock (but not actual priest's clothing), religious/authority appearance

-   [ ] **2.0.3. Enhanced Prompt Generation:**
    -   Modify `promptGenerationService.ts` to use database context when `retrievalMode === 'database'`
    -   Integrate `swarmui_prompt_fragment` from 37 location artifacts
    -   Use `swarmui_prompt_override` from 26 character-location contexts
    -   Apply location-specific visual descriptions and atmospheric context
    -   **Database Data Available:**
        - **12 detailed locations** with visual descriptions and atmosphere
        - **37 artifacts** with ready-to-use SwarmUI prompt fragments
        - **26 character-location contexts** with detailed appearance data
        - **6 complete SwarmUI prompt overrides** ready for immediate use

-   [ ] **2.0.4. Roadmap-Driven Location Resolution:**
    -   Implement system to read `roadmap_scenes.location_name` to determine actual story locations
    -   Map roadmap locations to appropriate SwarmUI overrides using locationOverrideMapping
    -   **Example:** When roadmap says "NHIA Facility 7", use Atlanta Emergency Zone character overrides
    -   **Reason:** NHIA Facility 7 is bombed/tactical environment requiring protective gear

-   [x] **2.0.5. Enhanced Episode Context JSON Structure:**
    -   **Current Structure Issues:**
        - Generic character descriptions (not location-specific)
        - Limited artifacts (8 vs 37 in database)
        - Missing atmospheric context
        - No SwarmUI prompt overrides
        - Hardcoded location descriptions
    -   **New Database-Driven Structure:**
        ```typescript

          tactical_override_applied: boolean;          // NEW: Whether tactical override used
        }
        ```
    -   **Implementation Benefits:**
        - **Location-Specific Characters:** Characters look different in each location
        - **Rich Artifact Data:** 37 artifacts vs 8 in current structure
        - **Atmospheric Context:** Mood and atmosphere for each location
        - **SwarmUI Integration:** Ready-to-use prompt overrides
        - **Tactical Override System:** Automatic mapping of tactical locations
        - **Database-Driven:** All data pulled from PostgreSQL, not hardcoded

### **2.1. SwarmUI API Service (ENHANCED)**

-   [ ] **2.1.1. Context-Enhanced Image Generation:**
    -   Implement `generateImage` function that accepts database context parameters
    -   Include location artifacts, character-location context, and atmospheric data
    -   Use database-specific SwarmUI prompt overrides when available
    -   **Enhanced SwarmUI Override Specifications:**
        ```typescript
        const swarmUIOverrides = {
          // FIELD LOCATIONS - Tactical/Combat
          "Atlanta Emergency Zone": {

## Beat Generation System Evolution

**Status:** ‚úÖ Functional but needs refinement
**Documentation:** See `docs/BEAT_GENERATION_EVOLUTION.md` for complete change history

### Current Achievement
- **91 NEW_IMAGE beats** generated (exceeds 11+ requirement)
- **Batch processing** implemented to handle large beat counts
- **Database context integration** working reliably
- **LORA trigger substitution** implemented
- **YOLO segmentation parameters** optimized for SwarmUI compatibility

### Known Issues for Future Refinement
1. **Over-generation**: 91 beats when only 11+ needed (inefficient)
2. **Image reuse too conservative**: Almost no REUSE_IMAGE beats
3. **Processing efficiency**: 5 API calls for prompt generation
4. **Beat granularity inconsistency**: Some too granular, others too broad
5. **Narrative content quality**: Some beats have minimal content

### Refinement Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Reduce beat count to 15-20 per scene, improve reuse logic
2. **Phase 2**: Quality enhancement and content validation
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced features and performance optimization

## YOLO Segmentation Optimization

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed
**Documentation:** See `docs/YOLO_SEGMENTATION_TUNING.md` for comprehensive tuning guide

### Problem Solved

- **Face detection accuracy** improved with balanced parameters
- **Model compatibility** updated to latest YOLO11 segmentation

### Technical Changes
**Before (Problematic):**
```
<segment:yolo-face_yolov9c.pt-INDEX,0.7,1>
```

**After (Optimized):**
```
<segment:yolo-face_yolo11m-seg.pt-INDEX,0.35,0.5>
```

### Key Improvements
- **Model**: `yolov9c.pt` ‚Üí `yolo11m-seg.pt` (latest YOLO11 medium)
- **Confidence**: `0.7` ‚Üí `0.35` (balanced detection threshold)
- **IoU**: `1` ‚Üí `0.5` (prevents SwarmUI warnings and resets)

### Files Modified

## Phase 3: Interactive Prompt Refinement

**Status:** üìã **PLANNED**
**Goal:** Empower users with a "human-in-the-loop" workflow to iteratively refine AI-generated prompts for maximum creative control.

-   [ ] **3.1: UI Hooks (`OutputPanel.tsx`):**
    -   [ ] Add a "Refine" button to each prompt display card (`cinematic` and `vertical`).
    -   [ ] The button click will trigger a handler in `App.tsx` to open the refinement modal, passing the specific beat and prompt type to be edited.
-   [ ] **3.2: State Management (`App.tsx`):**
    -   [ ] Create new state to manage the visibility of the refinement modal and the "beat in focus" for editing.
    -   [ ] Implement a handler function (`handleOpenRefineModal`) to set the target and show the modal.
    -   [ ] Implement a handler function (`handleSaveChanges`) that receives the updated prompt from the modal and patches it into the main `analyzedEpisode` state.
-   [ ] **3.3: The Refinement Modal (`components/RefineModal.tsx`):**
    -   [ ] Create a new modal component that overlays the main UI.
    -   [ ] It will feature a two-column layout: an editable prompt textarea on one side, and the "Context Tree" on the other.
    -   [ ] Include "Save Changes," "Cancel," and "Refine with AI" buttons.
-   [ ] **3.4: The Context Tree Component (`components/ContextTree.tsx`):**
    -   [ ] Create a new component to display the relevant scene context (characters, location details, artifacts) as a hierarchical, selectable list with checkboxes.
    -   [ ] Implement logic for parent/child selection dependencies.
    -   [ ] The component will report the array of selected `prompt_fragment` strings back to the `RefineModal`.
-   [ ] **3.5: The Refinement AI Service (`promptGenerationService.ts`):**
    -   [ ] Create a new exported function: `refinePrompt(currentPrompt: string, attributesToAdd: string[]): Promise<string>`.
    -   [ ] This function will use a new, specialized system instruction for Gemini, focused on surgical insertion and stylistic preservation.
    -   [ ] The function will return the newly refined prompt string for display in the modal's textarea.

## Phase 3.1: Advanced Hierarchical Prompt Generation (Risk-Free Approach)

**Status:** üìã **PROPOSED**
**Goal:** Enhance the prompt generator to understand and utilize the hierarchical location data (e.g., specific rooms within a building) to create visually consistent and recognizable backgrounds across different scenes in the same location. This will be implemented as a safe, parallel system that does not interfere with existing Phase 2 or 3 work.

-   [ ] **3.1.1: Non-Disruptive Database Augmentation:**
    -   [ ] Add two new nullable text fields to the `storyart_location_hierarchy` table:
        -   `defining_visual_features`: An array of keywords for specific sub-locations (e.g., `['rows of server racks', 'blinking status lights']` for a server room).
        -   `ambient_prompt_fragment`: A baseline visual description for parent locations to ensure a consistent look and feel (e.g., `"interior of a ruined CDC facility, brutalist concrete architecture, eerie silence"`).
    -   **Safety:** This is a non-destructive change. The existing application will be unaffected as it will ignore these new columns.

-   [ ] **3.1.2: Isolate New Logic in Parallel Functions:**
    -   [ ] Create a new function in `databaseContextService.ts`: `getHierarchicalLocationContext()`.
    -   [ ] Create a new, separate prompt generation function in `promptGenerationService.ts`: `generateHierarchicalSwarmUiPrompts()`.
    -   **Safety:** The original `generateSwarmUiPrompts()` function will remain completely untouched, isolating all new logic and preventing regressions.

-   [ ] **3.1.3: Implement a "Control Switch" (Feature Flag):**
    -   [ ] Introduce a new boolean parameter, `useHierarchicalPrompts`, to the main generation service.
    -   [ ] **Default (`false`):** The system will call the original, proven `generateSwarmUiPrompts()` function.
    -   [ ] **Activated (`true`):** The system will call the new `generateHierarchicalSwarmUiPrompts()` function.
    -   **Safety:** This provides complete control to test the new system on a per-run basis without impacting the default workflow.

-   [ ] **3.1.4: Design Graceful Fallbacks:**
    -   [ ] The new `generateHierarchicalSwarmUiPrompts()` will check if the required hierarchical data exists for a given location.
    -   [ ] If data is present, it will use the advanced, layered prompt construction.
    -   [ ] If data is missing, it will automatically fall back to the original method of using `locationAttributes` for that specific beat.
    -   **Safety:** This allows for incremental data population and testing. The system will remain robust even with incomplete data.

-   [ ] **3.1.5: Update Beat Analysis Process:**
    -   [ ] Enhance the initial script analysis to resolve beat locations to a specific `id` from the `storyart_location_hierarchy` table, which is required for the new service to fetch the correct context.
