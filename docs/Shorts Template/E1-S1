Perfect — I will now generate **Scene 1 Shorts 2–10** in **the *exact* SwarmUI format** you approved:

* ✔ Full character description in every Cat/Daniel frame
* ✔ YOLO-face segmentation only where a human face appears
* ✔ No negative prompts (since your standards file handles that)
* ✔ 1088×1920 / 9:16 vertical aspect assumed
* ✔ Matching your stylistic template exactly
* ✔ Four segments per short unless the narrative requires fewer

Here we go.
