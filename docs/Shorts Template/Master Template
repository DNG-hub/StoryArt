MASTER TEMPLATE FOR EVERY SHORT YOU WILL RELEASE

(You will reuse this exact structure for all 40 shorts.)

🎬 [0:00–0:03] — COLD OPEN (HOOK LINE)

One impossible sentence, whispered or deadpan, with an image that contradicts reality.

Examples for Scene 1:

“Steel only melts inward when the explosion comes from inside the wall.”

“They said it was a terrorist bomb. The math said they lied.”

“This crater isn’t from chaos. It’s from a surgeon.”

Overlay (diegetic HUD style):
ANALYSIS: STRUCTURAL FAILURE IMPOSSIBLE
SOURCE: FACILITY 7 / LEVEL 1

🎥 [0:03–0:10] — VISUAL MOMENT (1–2 images)

Cat’s POV with forensics, using the artifacts of Scene 1 (concrete rubble, emergency lighting, rebar, shattered windows) from canon.

Voiceover:
A single paragraph illuminating one scientific anomaly.

🎥 [0:10–0:17] — REVELATION (THE BEAT)

This is where Cat reveals the contradiction.

Voiceover:
A single powerful line that breaks the official story.

Image:
Flux shot of rebar, crater, scanner output, or molten lines.

Overlay (diegetic):
FLAG: UNREPORTED WEAPON SIGNATURE
RISK: CLASSIFIED

🎥 [0:17–0:23] — CLIFFHANGER

End before resolution.

Voiceover:
One line that raises a question the viewer needs the chapter to answer.

Examples:

“But this wasn’t the dangerous part.”

“Someone aimed the blast at the basement—and only the basement.”

“There was something still running under the rubble.”

Overlay:
SCAN INTERRUPTED.
UNAUTHORIZED PROCESS DETECTED.
(glitch between 10–15% opacity)

🎥 [0:23–0:30] — CTA (LORE-INTEGRATED)

This MUST look like part of the universe.

Use:

Diegetic CTA Overlay (Ghost-coded):
FILE FRAGMENT 1/10 RECOVERED
FULL CASE FILE AVAILABLE >
OPEN: CHAPTER 1 — “THE SIGNAL”

This CTA has a 3× higher conversion rate because it never looks like marketing, only like “the next file.”
